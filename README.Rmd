# Developing Data Products Project Documentation- Predicting Miles per Gallon

This project uses the mtcars dataset to find the best linear prediction model for oil consumption of cars based on certain car charactericts such as the weight, whether the car is automatic or manual etc.

To load and explore data set in R use data(mtcars)

The project tests all inputs and finds the best fit model based on AIC criterion and then takes the coefficients of the model and calculates the predicted (fitted values) based on a set of user defined inputs on car characteristics which include weight, how fast the car covers 1/4 of mile and whether it is automatic or manual.
